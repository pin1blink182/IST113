			<p> Welcome to my basic webpage about Fly Fishing! Here I will be practicing my web development
				skills by populating elements I implement with actual experiences. We will discuss everything
				from fishing techniques to different gear needed to approach the various species of
				New England and hopefully I'll be able to upload some results on the weekends once the season
				starts.</p>
		<h2>
			Types of fish I search for
		<h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Striper</li>
				<li>Large and Small mouth bass</li>
				<li>Any trout species native to NH</li>
				<li>Pickerel</li>
				<li>Creek Chubs</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>
			Most Important Things to Remember
		<h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Stay hidden from the fish! Try not to scare them away when approaching the body of water.</li>
				<li>Match the hatch! Look for local insects and what the baitfish look like and try to use flies that replicate them.</li>
				<li>Bring the correct gear and abide by the laws of each pond you visit</li>
			<ol>
